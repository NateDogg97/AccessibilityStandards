# accessibilityStandards
The Goal of Challenge 01 is to practice making a webpage more accessible to improve functionality

I successfully added HTML semantic elements wherever possible

I successfully added alt tags wherever necessary

I successfully combined identical CSS segments into one segment making the code more concise

I was able to make these changed to the code without effecting the final presentation of the webpage

I added notes to each line where I made changes
